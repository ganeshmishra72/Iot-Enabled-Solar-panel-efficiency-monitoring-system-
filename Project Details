IoT-Enabled Solar Panel Efficiency Monitoring System: Arduino UNO Code Description

1. Setup and Initialization:

Initializes the LCD (I2C) and Serial communication for data monitoring.

Defines pins for the current sensor (ACS712) and voltage input.

Configures the ESP32 for Wi-Fi (if IoT is enabled).



2. Reading Sensor Data:

Reads the solar panel voltage using an analog pin.

Reads the current from the ACS712 sensor using an analog pin.

Calculates power using the formula:
Power (W) = Voltage × Current

Computes efficiency using a predefined formula:
Efficiency (%) = (Output Power / Input Power) × 100



3. Data Display:

Displays voltage, current, and efficiency values on the LCD.

Updates the display every few seconds.



4. Data Transmission (IoT):

Sends the monitored data (Voltage, Current, Efficiency) to a cloud server (like ThingSpeak or Firebase) using ESP32.
